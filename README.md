# ourPetProject
Front-End Group Project

## General Project Summary:
I am making a shelter pet app that displays pets up for adoption close to a users zip code with a map, images (Flickr and from the shelter), description, special needs, wikipedia article about that particular breed (if one is provided) as well as care information. Users will also be shown local pet stores and vets, and can leave a review of their pet via Fireside chat.
