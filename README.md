# ourPetProject
Front-End Group Project

## General Project Summary:
We are making a petfinder that displays pets up for adoption close to the users address (or if they prefer, by breed available in any location) with images, (possibly videos), and wikipedia articles about that particular breed as well as care information. Users will also be shown local pet stores and vets.
